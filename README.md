# Placement_Counselling_System

It is often a challenge for college students in India to decide what stream they should pursue after their graduation. They are unsure about what they should learn, the types of projects they should make and add to their resumes, how to get started in a new field and so on. There is no proper guidance given to these students and as a result, they end up following whatever their fellow friends are doing. One solution to this problem is to connect them with similar minded alumni of their college. In doing so, they are able to get connected to a mentor or a guide who has been in the shoes of the students and has more experience. In this project, we attempt to make a clustering model using data scraped from the most popular job search and networking platform, LinkedIn. We also develop a domain classification model that helps the students in identifying what domain is suitable for them depending on some specific input values.
